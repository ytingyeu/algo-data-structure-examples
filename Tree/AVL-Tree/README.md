# Notes
## Definitions

`height_of_node = 1 + max(get_height(left_child), get_height(right_child))`

`balance_factor = get_height(left_child) - get_height(right_child)`

Balance factor of a balanced tree should always be in [-1, 0, 1].

## Insert a new node
Insertion is the same as standard BST.

## Delete a node
Deletion is the same as standard BST:

### Case 1: node that going to be deleted has no child
Just remove the targeted node.

### Case 2: node that going to be deleted has single child

1. Replace the targeted node with its child.
2. Delete the child node.

In standard BST, we have to handle potential grandchildren.
But in a balanced tree, a node with single child should not have any grandchild.
Thus, we can simply delete the child node.

### Case 3: node that going to be deleted has two children

1. Find the inorder successor.
2. Replace the targeted node with the successor.
3. Delete the successor recursively. (the successor has at most one child -- right child)
